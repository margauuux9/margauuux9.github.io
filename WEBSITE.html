<p><strong>ABOUT THIS LANDSCAPES </strong></p>

<p>Reunion Island is 255 times smaller than France and yet abounds in diverse landscapes.<br> 
You can see its peaks like the Piton des Neiges, or the Piton de la Fournaise which is its volcano. 
There are also its circuses, Cilaos, Salazie and Mafate and its high ramparts which are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 
</br>
The Piton de la Fournaise is one of the most striking places on the island. In a few kilometers the green tropical landscape becomes a mineral and lunar desert. One or two spectacular eruptions can be observed per year.
